1. [DONE] Run watch after compile (because browserify:watch may fire on coffee:compile)

  Actual:

  compile------
               browser-sync-----
     watch----------------------

  Expected:

  compile-----
              browser-sync-----
              watch------------

2. [DONE] Cleanup

3. Error handling
  [DONE for CoffeeScript]
  [DONE for Jade]
  [FIXED] ISSUE: If very first CoffeeScript watch encounters an error, it breaks pipe.
  [FIXED] ISSUE: Jade plumber needs to be places in different place (watch -> plumber -> lazypipe),
    and also throws out the very first error, but doesn't break

4. Vim saves twice - why? even with set nowritebackup

5. [DONE] Test with initially non-existing folders

6. [DONE - npm package]
  Think how to make it submoduleable

7. [DONE] Lib files copying to dest

8. [DONE] Coffee watch must start after coffee compile, not after all compile (to prevent missing changes)

9. [DONE] Error messages
