1. [DONE] Run watch after compile (because browserify:watch may fire on coffee:compile)

  Actual:

  compile------
               browser-sync-----
     watch----------------------

  Expected:

  compile-----
              browser-sync-----
              watch------------

2. [DONE] Cleanup

3. Error handling
  [DONE for CoffeeScript]
  [DONE for Jade]
  [FIXED] ISSUE: If very first CoffeeScript watch encounters an error, it breaks pipe.
  [FIXED] ISSUE: Jade plumber needs to be places in different place (watch -> plumber -> lazypipe),
  and also throws out the very first error, but doesn't break

4. Vim saves twice - why? even with set nowritebackup

5. Test with initially non-existing folders

6. Think how to make it submoduleable

7. Lib files copying to dest

8. Coffee watch must start after coffee compile, not after all compile (to prevent missing changes)

9. Error messages
