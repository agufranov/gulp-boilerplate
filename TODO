1. [DONE] Run watch after compile (because browserify:watch may fire on coffee:compile)

  Actual:

  compile------
               browser-sync-----
     watch----------------------

  Expected:

  compile-----
              browser-sync-----
              watch------------

2. [DONE] Cleanup

3. Error handling

4. Vim saves twice - why? even with set nowritebackup

5. Test with initially non-existing folders

6. Think how to make it submoduleable
